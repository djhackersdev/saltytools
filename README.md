# Saltytools

A toolkit for dumping and perhaps some day re-packing the proprietary file formats used by various Konami arcade games. Currently implemented using a very pedantic style of C99, these tools are small and UNIX-y, and are designed to be chained together into game-specific asset dumping pipelines by means of shell scripts.

This toolkit is primarily intended to accommodate my own personal preferences and use cases, although maybe somebody else might find it useful as well. Similar tools with a richer feature set than this project can be found at the following location(s):
